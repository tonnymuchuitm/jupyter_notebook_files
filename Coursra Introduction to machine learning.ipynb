    "       - eg, after seeing a training set of labelled images, an image classifier can figure out how to          apply labels accurately to new, previously unseen images\n",
    "  - Algorithms lear rules from labelled examples\n",
    "  - A set of labelled examples used for larning is called training data\n",
    "  - The learned rules should be able to generalize to correctly recognize or predict new examples not       in training set\n",
