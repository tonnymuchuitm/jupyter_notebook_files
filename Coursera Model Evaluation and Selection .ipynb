    "#### Precision-Recall and ROC curves\n",
    "- precision-recall curves are widely used evaluation method from machine learning.\n",
    "- as we saw in the previous example, the x-axis shows precision and the y-axis shows recall.\n",
    "- an ideal classifier would be able to achieve perfect precision of 1.0 and perfect recall of 1.0. so the optimal point would be up in the top right corner.\n",
    "-in general, with precision-recall curves, the closer in some sense the curve is to the top right corner, the more prefferable it is , the more beneficial the tradeoff it gives between precision and recall.\n",
    "#### ROC curves\n",
    "- ROC curves or reciever operating characteristic curves are a very widely used visualization method that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier.\n",
    "- ROC curves on the X-axis show a classifier's False Positive Rate so that would go from 0 to 1,\n",
    "- on the y-axis they show a classifiers true positive rate so that will also go from 0 to 1.0\n",
    "- the ideal point in ROC space is one where the classifier achieves zero, a false positive rate of zero and a true positive rate of one. so that would be the upper left corner.\n",
    "- So curves in ROC space represent different tradeoffs as the decision boundary, the decision threshold is varied for the classifier. So just as in the precision recall case, as we vary decision threshold, we'll get different numbers of false positives and true positives that we can plot on a chart.\n",
    "- The dotted line here that I'm showing is the classifier curve that secretly results from a classifier that randomly guesses the label for a binary class.\n",
    "-It's basically like flipping a coin. If you have two classes with equal numbers of positive and negative incidences, then\n",
    "- flipping a coin will get you randomly equal numbers of false positives and true positives for a large virus data sets. So the dotted line here is used as a base line. So bad classifier will have performance that is random or maybe even worse than random or be slightly better than random. Reasonably good classifier will give an ROC curve that is consistently better than random across all decision threshold choices.\n",
    "- And then an excellent classifier would be one like I've shown here, which is way up into the left.\n",
    "- This particular example is an example of a logistic regression classifier using the notebook example you've seen.\n",
    "![Title](Screenshot_140.png)\n",
    "- So, the shape of the curve can be important as well, the steepness of the curve, we want classifiers that maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate.\n",
    "- Now as we'll see next, we can qualify the goodness of a classifier in some sense by looking at how much area there is underneath the curve.\n",
    "- So the area underneath the random classifier is going to be 0.5 but then the area, as you can see, the size of the bumpiness of the classifier as it approaches the top left corner. Well, the area underneath the curve will get larger and larger. It will approach 1. And so, as we'll see in the next slide.\n",
    "- We use something called area under the curve, AUC. That's the single number that measures this total area underneath the ROC curve as a way to summarize a classifier's performance. So, an AUC of zero represents a very bad classifier, and an AUC of one will represent an optimal classifier."

    "#### Regression evaluation\n",
    "- in practice it turns out that for most applications of regression, distinguishing between these types of different errors (precision and recall) is not as important\n",
    "- in most cases, the r-squared score thats available for regression in scikit-learn and that summarizes how well future instances will be predicted is adequate for most tasks.\n",
    "- as a reminder, the r-squared score for a perfect predictor is 1.0 and for a predictor that always outputs the same constant value, the r-squared score is 0.0.\n",
    "- The r-squared score despite the squared in the name that suggests its always positive does have the potential for bad model fits, such as when fitting non-linear functions to data.\n",
    "- there are a few alternative regression devaluation metrics you should be aware of that work differently than the r-squared score.\n",
    "- **Mean absolute error** takes the mean absolute difference between the target and predicted values.\n",
    "- in machine learning terms this corresponds to the expected value of L1 norm laws.\n",
    "- this is sometimes used for example to asses focused outcomes for regression in time series analysis.\n",
    "- **Mean squared error** takes the mean squared difference between the target and predicted values and this corresponds to the expected value of the L2 norm loss.\n",
    "- This is widely used for many regression problems and larger errors have correspondingly larger squared contributions to the mean error\n",
    "- like mean absolute error, mean squared error does not distinguish between over and under estimates\n",
    "- finally, one situation that arrises quite often is the existence of outliers in the data, which can have unwanted influence on the overall r-squared value. \n",
    "- in those casses, when ignoring outliers is important, you can use the **median_absolute_error*** score, which is robust with the presence of outliers because it uses the median of the error distribution rather than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dummy regressors\n",
    "- we saw how using dummy classifiers could give us simple but useful baselines to compare aganist when evaluating a classifier. The same exists for regression\n",
    "- There is a dummy regressor class that provides prediction using simple strategies that do not look at the input data.\n"
